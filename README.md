# Made for my set: Logitech Z-5500

I've no longer got the set, so bear with me. When opening an issue, I can accept PRs, but I can also transfer the app if you are interested in keeping it up to date!.

This app adds infrared support for the popular Logitech sound system the Z-5500. It contains flow cards with IR commands, and offers a nice experience giving the button page a few extra commonly used commands.

I've added a placeholder for the Z-906 (including my icons ;) ), yet the prontohex codes are just copied and likely not working.
